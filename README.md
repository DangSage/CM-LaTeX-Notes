# CM-LaTeX-Notes
general programming + mathematics notes in LaTeX

This repo is my examples of LaTeX and just getting used to using it in general.

## Feel free to use or make a copy using my .tex files as your template!
My personal workflow uses WSL to be able to save and compile this project of my notes with LaTeX. 
Of course, this is just straight `.tex` files, but you can compile them yourself as well.

Read `basic.tex` for more info if this is your first time getting started with LaTeX!

## Requirements:
- LaTeX: install via ```sudo apt-get install texlive-base``` (Ubuntu)

Make sure you have the right distribution of texlive and the needed packages for your system.
